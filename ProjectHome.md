A panel covering a grid of (currently) 21x21 regions showing the maptiles of the 21x21 regions and on the side various topics like

  * shopping
  * clubbing
  * recreations
  * etc..

clicking on each topic will show the regions offering those possibilities as dots on the map where the avatar can click onto and will be then teleported to.

The project consists of two main parts:

  1. A bunch of LSL/OS - Scripts
  1. A server side component where all locations are managed in order to make the teleporters self configurable
